    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yeast Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the
        ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water
        with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and
        speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when
        it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bread Flour Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates
        chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more
        protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the
        crust elasticity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Olive Oil Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza
        crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier
        between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens
        the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation
        (resulting in a better rise).
      </li>
    </ul>
