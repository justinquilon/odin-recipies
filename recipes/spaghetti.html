      This million dollar spaghetti dish features a beefy, creamy tomato sauce
      that’s impossible to resist.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Spaghetti: An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight
        servings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beef: You’ll need a pound of lean ground beef. You can use a mix of
        ground beef and ground turkey, if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spaghetti sauce: Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your
        own marinara sauce at home.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add
        richness and flavor to the baked spaghetti.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream: A mixture of cottage
        cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is essential for this decadent,
        creamy spaghetti sauce.

        Cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this
        million dollar spaghetti.
